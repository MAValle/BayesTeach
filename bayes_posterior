# R-Function that computes the posterior probability -----
# Consider the next problem as an example to understand the code: 

# We have two spinners T1 and T2. Each spinner has two colors, R and V. 
# At T1, the probability of R is 1/2 and at T2 the probability of R is 0.3.
# So, P(R|T1)=0.5 and P(R|T2)=0.3.
# We spin a spinner, and it comes out and R-color
# What's the probability of that being from T1 (or T2)?. ie, P(T1|R).
# Initially we assumed that P(T1)=(T2)=0.5 (prior).

# Inputs to the function: 
# source: vector od spinners, could be a string vector.
# prior: priors numeric vector 
# like: likelihood muneric vector

# Notes:
# prior has length equal to the number of -colors- in the experiment. 
# source has length equal to the number of -spinners-
# like has length equal to the number -colors- 

Output: data frame with 4 columns: source, prior, likelihood, and posterior

# example:
# df <- bayes_posterior(fuente = c("T1", "T2"), prior=c(1/2, 1/2), like=c(1/2, 1/3))

bayes_posterior <- function(fuente, prior, like) {
  producto <- prior*like
  marg <- sum(producto)
  posterior <- producto/marg
  df <- data.frame(Fuente= fuente, Prior=prior, Likelihood=like, Posterior=posterior)
  return(df)
}
